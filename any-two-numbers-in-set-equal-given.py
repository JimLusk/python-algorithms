Algorithm Objective
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
Bonus: Can you do this in one pass? 
"""

# Create a variable to hold set of numbers to traverse

# Iterate over set adding 1s number in set to all that follow in set, if it equals given return true.
